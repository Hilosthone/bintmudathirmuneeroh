    <h2>To Doc. Bint Muneeroh — The Heart That Guides My Words</h2>
    <p>Some people teach with books in hand,</p>
    <p>But you, dear Doc, you helped me stand.</p>
    <p>Not just in rhythm, rhyme, or meter,</p>
    <p>But as a writer, and something deeper.</p>

    <p>You saw the trembling in my voice,</p>
    <p>Yet still, you smiled and gave me choice —</p>
    <p>To trust my pen, to shape my name,</p>
    <p>To find my truth inside the flame.</p>

    <p>You never asked for thanks or praise,</p>
    <p>You simply gave, in countless ways.</p>
    <p>You met each line I wrote with care,</p>
    <p>And shaped my thoughts with love and flair.</p>

    <p>In every poem I now create,</p>
    <p>Your kindness echoes through each gate.</p>
    <p>You've been the calm, the light, the guide,</p>
    <p>Who stood so gently by my side.</p>

    <p>So here's to you on this special day,</p>
    <p>With heartfelt words I long to say:</p>
    <p>May joy surround you, soft and wide,</p>
    <p>Like poems blooming deep inside.</p>

    <p>And may you know, both near and far,</p>
    <p>How treasured, loved, and rare you are.</p>
    <p>Happy Birthday, my mentor,</p>
    <p>This poet walks, because of you.</p>
